# Flask Workshop

This workshop is a basic introduction to Flask, a popular webframework for
Python. Flask allows you to build Web applications in a simple way. An alternate
is Django, which follows a batteries-included approach. Flask follows the
opposite approach.

Flask can be used to build many things, from complex web applications to IoT
projects such as the speaker's [Speaking Bookshelf](https://youtu.be/aEYftBZz6ag).
